After working on this project, we gained so much knowledge and skills which will
help us in the upcoming projects so we can do better job and save time by
avoiding the mistakes we made.

## Continue Doing

- Welcome Constructive Criticism.
- Team spirit and work.
- Make a little bit more time for meetings and discussions.

## Start Doing

## Lessons Learned

- How to communicate as a team. Hear out our ideas, discuss them and come up
  with the best strategy.
- Plan the project: how to manage our time and divide the work in a suitable way
  and give it enough period of time.
- Working as a team: Besides working on our tasks to finish the project, we
  still helped each other.
- Reading errors: When a new error comes, we read it carefully and try to
  understand it. If we couldn't understand the issue, we google it.
- Gained some knowledge of HTML and CSS however we still have a lot to learn.
